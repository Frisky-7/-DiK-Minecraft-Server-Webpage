    <hr>
    <p>Here is an overview of the current progress in the WoD: <br>
    Currently there is one community set up to the east of the starting spawn point, called Agaria, and is listed below. </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>List of Settlements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Agaria.html">Agaria</a> </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Server Economy</h3>
    <p>The main goal with the server economy is to have a central database for the prices of goods between certain settlements. <br>
    This allows travellers to look up what each settlement offers and specializes in, allowing them to get the best cost for goods. <br>
