    <h1>Agaria</h1>
    <p> <i>The oldest and largest settlement.</i> </p>

    <hr>
    <p>Agaria is currently the biggest, and is the oldest settlement on the server.<br>
    It is currently going under massive expansion to supply the needs of all travellers. <br>
    Currently it boasts ample land for personal shelters, a tavern with you basic needs, and also a weapons manufactory and reloading. <br>
    It is also currently the <strong>largest</strong> supplier of electricity to the power grid, with plans to expand as needed. </p>

    <h3>Tavern - <i>The Miner 69'er</i> </h3>
    <img src="images/Tavern_Outside.png" alt="Miner 69'er" class="center">
    <p>One of the original buildings in the settlement of Agaria. <br>
    It's main purpose is a gathering area for any travellers, and to provide them with the basic necessities, such as food and basic tools - for a fee of course. <br>
    While taking full advantage of the modpack, the basic accepted currency is the coins that are included with the modpack, resulting in a somewhat limited supply, due to the nature of obtaining the coins. <br>
    Thus meaning the coins themselves are anti-inflationary and keep the value they are assigned, as they are physical entities. </p>

    <h3>Frisk_E's Firearms & Ammunition</h3>
    <img src="images/FriskFirearms.png" alt="Firearms & Ammo" class="center">
    <p>One of the newer editions to Agaria, Frisk_E's Firearms aims to provide more advanced weaponry to travellers, as well as supply them with all sorts of ammunition. <br>
    With the threat of raids (by NPC's) on the server, it is important to have a substantial defence. <br>
    A future update of this site will have a link to the available options and prices at this store. </p>

    <h3>Power Station</h3>
    <img src="images/Power_Station.png" alt="Agaria's Power Supply" class="center">
    <p>Constructed alongside the Tavern, it provides (currently) free power to any building in Agaria.<br>
    Although it is currently free, potentially any new buildings may be charged for power usage after the installation of the electric fence on top of the wall - resulting in the need for massive powergrid expansion. </p>
